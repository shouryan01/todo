## Why build a to-do app?

There are a million to-do apps out there. Building a to-do app is often the first tutorial when learning a new platform or framework. However, there was not a single product that met my unique needs, necessitating the creation of this product.

Reasons this exists:

- privacy
- create a sense of ephemeralism
- minimal and beautiful solution did not exist as per my personal design preferences

I work a desk job at my university and my supervisor would give me a list of tasks every shift.
I would list these down in my Google Tasks but I didn't want to have my Gmail tab open because of privacy reasons. This is unfortunately the only way to use Google Tasks.
I would sometimes write a whole bunch of tasks down, forget about them and have them not complete. The cloud backup and sync didn't create a sense of urgency for me.

I created this to-do app because:

- It was a design perfectly tailored to my personal preferences.
- I didn't have to sign in, make any new accounts in a 3rd party service, accept free trials, etc.
- I didn't have to keep my Gmail open and just have a list of my tasks displayed.
- There was initially no storage whatsoever. This meant that if I closed the browser tab, I would lose all the data, forcing me to actually close out all the tasks. This was later replaced by a local storage solution because I accidently closed a tab once.
- I wanted to see how quickly I could whip something up. Turns out, pretty quickly.

### Feel free to use this! It's completely free and uses GitHub Pages, making it free forever.
